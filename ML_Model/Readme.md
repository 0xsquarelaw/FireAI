## Welcome to the FireAI Cybersecurity Project

We hope this repository serves as a starting point for addressing cybersecurity challenges and fostering collaboration within the community. Feel free to explore, contribute, and share your ideas with us. Together, we can build a more secure and resilient digital environment.

Below is a detailed overview of the main sections:

### 1. `main.py`

In the `main.py` file, you'll find the core of our solution. This main script integrates a variety of functionalities and utilities for data analysis, task automation, and security management in computer environments. From managing network packets to detecting anomalies, `main.py` provides a centralized interface for exploring and protecting digital infrastructures.

By training a model, we can recognize and identify some types of attacks. For example:

- **Generic:** Non-specific attacks that may include a variety of techniques. To mitigate these attacks, general security measures should be implemented such as using firewalls, regular software updates, and educating users about safe online practices.
- **Fuzzers:** Attacks that use automated tools to send random or manipulated inputs to a system in order to find vulnerabilities. To mitigate these attacks, techniques such as static and dynamic code analysis can be employed, as well as comprehensive penetration testing to identify and correct vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
- **Analysis:** Attacks involving detailed system or network traffic analysis to identify weaknesses or behavioral patterns. To mitigate these attacks, it is crucial to continuously monitor and analyze network traffic and system logs to detect unusual or malicious activities.
- **Backdoors:** Attacks involving the insertion of backdoors into a system to allow unauthorized access in the future. To mitigate these attacks, robust security practices such as strict access control, two-factor authentication, and regular system auditing for suspicious activities should be implemented.
- **DoS (Denial of Service):** Attacks that attempt to flood a system, service, or network with malicious or legitimate traffic to exhaust its resources and make it inaccessible to legitimate users. To mitigate these attacks, techniques such as bandwidth limiting, IP address filtering, and the implementation of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) can be used.
- **Exploits:** Attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in software or hardware to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions on a system. To mitigate these attacks, it is essential to regularly apply security patches and updates, as well as implement security policies that limit user privileges and minimize exposure to known threats.
- **Reconnaissance:** Attacks involving the collection of information about a system, network, or entity to identify potential entry points or security weaknesses. To mitigate these attacks, security measures such as hiding sensitive information, network segmentation, and firewall implementation to limit network visibility and accessibility from the outside should be implemented.
- **Shellcode:** Attacks involving the execution of malicious code on a system through vulnerabilities in applications or services. To mitigate these attacks, security techniques such as input validation, access control to critical resources, and running applications in sandboxed environments or containers to limit the impact of potential exploits should be implemented.
- **Worms:** Attacks that spread from one system to another without human intervention, using network or software vulnerabilities for propagation. To mitigate these attacks, measures such as network segmentation, security patch implementation, and user education on safe browsing and file downloading practices should be applied. Additionally, active monitoring of network traffic can help detect and stop worm propagation before causing significant damage.

### 2. Phishing

The phishing-dedicated section focuses on addressing one of the most prevalent threats in cyberspace. Here, we offer tools and strategies for the detection, prevention, and mitigation of phishing attacks. From awareness techniques to suspicious email analysis, this section is designed to strengthen resilience against phishing.

### 3. Network Analysis

In this section, we delve into comprehensive network traffic analysis. From real-time monitoring to pattern and anomaly identification, we explore techniques and tools to understand and protect network infrastructures. Whether seeking emerging threats or conducting retrospective analysis, you'll find resources here to strengthen your network security.

#### Extensive Network Analysis

This Python script is designed to perform comprehensive analysis of network traffic using the Scapy library. Through capturing and processing packets in real-time, it provides valuable information about network connections, including traffic statistics, connection states, and protocol details.

#### Key Features

- **Packet Capture:** The script utilizes the `sniff` function of Scapy to capture incoming and outgoing network packets.
  
- **Protocol Analysis:** Identifies the protocols used in the captured packets, including TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
  
- **Connection Tracking:** Tracks TCP and UDP connections, maintaining records of connection states, source and destination ports, as well as involved IP addresses.
  
- **Bit Rate Calculation:** Calculates the destination bit rate to evaluate traffic load on the network.
  
#### Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.12 and Scapy 2.5.0 library installed in your environment. Additionally, you need to have Npcap installed to capture packets on the network.

2. Run the `main.py` script in your preferred terminal or IDE.

3. Observe the script output for detailed information about network traffic, including used protocols, IP addresses, ports, and connection states.

#### Notes

- It's important to note that this network analysis script runs in real-time. It may be necessary to run the script with elevated privileges depending on your system's security configuration.

- It is recommended to use this script with caution and in controlled environments, as it may generate a large amount of output and consume network and CPU resources.
